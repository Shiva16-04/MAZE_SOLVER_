# MAZE_SOLVER_
1. Developed a 2D Maze Solver which has the capability to visually animate the traversal paths of different traversal algorithms like Depth first Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra in a 2D grid from a start point to end point.

2. Provided user the flexibility to relocate starting point and ending point and given the ability to draw blocks. Vedio file is enclosed below showing the functionality of all these 3 options.

4. User can control the animation delay/speed in milliseconds(ms) with in the range provided (0 ms to 100 ms) with the default as 15 ms to view the path followed by different traversing algorithms like (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search and Dijkstra) at their own pace.

5. Working of BFS Algorithm in real time with default animation speed of 15ms is provided below
